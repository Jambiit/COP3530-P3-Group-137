    <h1>Welcome to Group 173's Project 3!</h1>

    <p>This is a project for <a href="https://ufl.instructure.com/courses/500074">COP3530: Data Structures and Algorithms</a>.</p>

    <p>We built a search engine to organize <strong>100,000</strong> Neocities websites for your purusing pleasure!</p>
    
    
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>To sort through 100,000 of anything is a lot of work, so we utilized a few data structures to help the process out. Right now, we have two data structures simulated here:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="graph.html"> Graph</a></li>
      <li> <a href="graph.html"> Hashmap</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Do mind the graphical simplicity, this website is bound to be improved as our methods for searching (and eye for design) get better!</p>
    

    <p>Latest Update:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>A hashmap!<em><a href="graph.html"> WOAH!</a> </em></li>
      <li>A graph! <em><a href="graph.html"> WOW!</a> </em></li>
      
    </ul>
